## Truncated Hierarchical B-Splines in Python

This repository contains a Python-implementation of truncated hierarchical B-splines, and methods for the assembly of stiffness matrices
and mass matrices. The code is currently in a fairly undocumented state, and may contain bugs - so use at your own discretion.

The implementation is based on the article [Algorithms for the implementation of adaptive isogeometric methods using hierarchical B-splines](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnum.2017.08.006),
and is heavily influenced by the [GeoPDEs](http://rafavzqz.github.io/geopdes/) Matlab/Octave package for isogeometric analysis developed by the authors.
